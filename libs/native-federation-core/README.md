# @softarc/native-federation

This is the **framework- and bundler-agnostic** foundation for Native Federation.

Please find here an [example project](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/native-federation-core-example.git). There, have a look at ``build/build-common.ts``. 

There is also an [Angular-specific wrapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-architects/native-federation).
